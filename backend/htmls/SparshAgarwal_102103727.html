<p>Performance Comparison of Path Optimization Algorithms </p><p>Problem Definition </p><p>Objective: Compare the performance of the CR-TB-Bellman, CR-ID-Bellman, and PO-Bellman algorithms in terms of: 1. Total steps required to reach the goal state. 2. The cumulative reward obtained during the journey. </p><p>Problem Setup </p><p>A grid-based environment is used to model the problem of finding the shortest path from a starting state to a goal state. The agent must navigate through the grid, earning rewards or penalties for its actions, while each algorithm updates its Q-values differently. </p>
